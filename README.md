# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis: From Casual Riders to Annual Members

## 1. Executive Summary

This case study is part of my data analytics portfolio. **Cyclistic**, a bike-share program in Chicago, aims to maximize the number of annual memberships to ensure long-term growth.

The goal of this project is to analyze historical trip data to identify how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on these insights, I will provide data-driven recommendations for a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## 2. Business Challenge

4.  **Analyze:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns and trends.
5.  **Share:** Create compelling visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
6.  **Act:** Provide the top three recommendations based on the analysis.

## Introduction

Cyclistic is a fictional company launched in Chicago in 2016. The company specializes in providing residents with bicycles for use within the city. Currently, they have more than **5,800 bicycles** and more than **650 docking stations**.

Cyclistic offers flexible plans for utilizing their equipment:

-   Single-ride pass\
-   Full-day pass\
-   Annual membership

The first two categories are considered ***Casual riders*** (Customers according to the records), while the third category consists of ***Cyclistic members*** (Subscribers according to the records).

In addition to conventional bicycles, Cyclistic provides three inclusive options:

:::

The marketing analyst team, led by Director Lily Moreno, has identified that 92% of users utilize conventional bicycles. Furthermore, 70% of users use the equipment for recreational purposes, while the remaining 30% use it as a means of transportation to work.

Given that annual memberships yield the highest profits, the marketing team aims to better understand users, their needs, and attraction channels (digital media) to **convert casual riders into Cyclistic members**.

## 1. Ask

### Business Task
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify key differences in how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic's bike-share service. By extracting these insights from historical trip data, I aim to provide data-driven recommendations for a marketing strategy specifically designed to convert casual riders into long-term annual members, thereby driving sustainable growth for the company.

### Key Stakeholders
* **Lily Moreno:** Director of Marketing and my manager. She is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
* **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic’s marketing strategy.
* **Cyclistic Executive Team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team who will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

### Primary Question
To guide the marketing strategy, this report focuses on answering:    
**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## 2. Prepare

### Data Sources
For this analysis, I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to identify trends. To ensure technical efficiency and follow project guidelines, the scope is limited to the following datasets:  

**1.-**   **Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv**  
**2.-**   **Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv**

This data is public and has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

### Data Credibility (ROCCC Analysis)
* **Reliable:** The data is accurate and complete, representing a full quarter of activity for each year.
* **Original:** The data comes directly from the City of Chicago’s bike-share program (Divvy).
* **Comprehensive:** It includes essential variables such as ride duration, start/end times, and station names.
* **Current:** While from 2019-2020, it provides the necessary historical context to answer the primary business question.
* **Cited:** The data is officially documented and maintained by the service provider.

### Data Integrity & Privacy
* **Privacy:** To protect user identity, personally identifiable information (PII) such as credit card numbers and home addresses has been excluded from the datasets.
* **Limitations:** Demographic data (gender and age) is available for 2019 but was removed from the 2020 dataset; therefore, this analysis will focus primarily on usage patterns rather than demographics.
